Steps to follow to run the tool offline :

Step 1 : Download and install python from https://www.python.org/downloads/

Step 2 : Download below from GitHub : https://github.com/AuditInsights/DataMasking and unzip contents to a folder

install_dependencies.py
streamlit run Data_Masking_App.py

Step 3 : Run dependencies

3.1 Go to folder where step 1 is downloaded
3.2 Click on address bar of the folder
3.3 type "cmd" (without quotes) in the address bar.  This will open command prompt for the folder
3.4 Type "py install_dependencies.py" (without quotes) and press Enter

Wait for the dependencies to be installed.  You will see this message "âœ… All packages installed successfully!"

Step 4 : run data masking app

4.1 Type "streamlit run Data_Masking_App.py" (without quotes) in the same command prompt for the folder and press Enter
4.2 Web browser will open (Chrome, Edge, etc) in your local machine

Step 5 : Use the app - App is running in your own machine


IMPORTANT : 

(1) Do not close the command prompt when you are using the app.  App will not work if command prompt is closed
(2) Step 3 : Run dependencies need to be run only once in a machine
(3) When you have closed the app and want to use it again, just follow Step 4 : run data masking app
(4) Unzip contents that you have downloaded from GitHub in a folder.  Will not work, if above steps are followed in a zipped folder
